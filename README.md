# Image Filtering & Hybridization
This is a simple mini-project that I worked on while taking the Computer Vision Course (CIE 552) at my university. It is the same project offered by [Georgia Tech](https://faculty.cc.gatech.edu/~hays/compvision2017/proj1/). In this project, I worked on Image filtering and hybrid-image generation.
